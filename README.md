## dsacademy.lk Data Science Bootcamp Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

I started by exploring the data and identified columns with missing values and incorrect data types.

 * Addressed Missing Data: I first handled all instances of missing data to ensure completeness.
 * Corrected Data Types: Next, I adjusted the data types of columns to match their correct formats.
 * Identified Outliers: After that, I conducted an outlier analysis to pinpoint any anomalies.
 * Refined Dataset: Finally, I updated the dataset based on the insights gained from the outlier analysis to enhance its quality.
